# Ride-Hailing Price Prediction Project

## Overview 

Welcome to the Ride-Hailing Price Prediction project! This project aims to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate ride-hailing prices based on various features. The goal is to help a ride-hailing platform predict the price of rides accurately, ensuring competitive pricing and improved customer satisfaction.


## Objective

This project seeks to develop a Linear Regression model specifically designed to predict ride-hailing prices accurately based on selected features. Evaluation metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and R2 score will be used to assess the model's performance and predictive accuracy.

## Summary

### Project Overview

This project involves the following components:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring and visualizing the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Preparing the data for modeling, including scaling and splitting the dataset.
4. **Model Definition and Training**: Building and training the Linear Regression model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Saving and Inference**: Saving the trained model and using it to make predictions on new data.
7. **Conceptual Understanding**: Answering theoretical questions related to Linear Regression.

### Steps and Instructions

#### 1. Data Loading

- **Process**: Load the dataset, rename columns if necessary, and check the dataset size.
- **Outcome**: A cleaned and well-structured dataset ready for analysis.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
- **Missing Values**: Check and handle any missing values in the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Create visualizations (histograms, pairplots) to explore the relationships between variables.

#### 3. Feature Engineering

- **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Normalization**: Scale the features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which helps in improving model performance.

#### 4. Model Definition and Training

- **Model Selection**: Choose Linear Regression as the model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Hyperparameters**: Define any hyperparameters for the model.
- **Training**: Train the model using the training data.

#### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
- **Visualization**: Plot actual vs. predicted prices to visualize the model's performance.

#### 6. Model Saving and Inference

- **Model Saving**: Save the trained model and any preprocessing steps (e.g., scaler) for future use.
- **Inference**: Use the saved model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

#### 7. Conceptual Understanding

- **Linear Regression Assumptions**: Explain the assumptions of Linear Regression in your own words.
- **Slope and Intercept Interpretation**: Interpret the meaning of the slope and intercept from the trained model.
